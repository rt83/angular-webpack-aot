# Angular application with Webpack

A simple skeleton for an Angular app with Webpack. This repository doesn't aim to be a ready to use skeleton for serious application but to be a very easy to understand example of:

* Development mode with webpack-serve for watching source change
* Production mode with ngtools/webpack to enable AOT
* Lazy loading configuration
* Incorporation of external javascript libraries (e.g. jquery, timepicker, etc.. )
* Incorporation of style libraries from npm (e.g. bootstrap, simple-line-icon)
